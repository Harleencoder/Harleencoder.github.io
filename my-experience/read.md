## **DAY 1**
- My first day at **GNDEC** started with all the  students assembling  in the **COLLEGE GURUDWARA SAHIB**  for kirtan and ardas 
- After that all students assembled in auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, **Harpreet Mam**. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the **GNDEC** family.

Our **Principal Sir** then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: **“Seize the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”**

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: **“Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn.”**

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again.

 - Firstly we went to **HARDWARE LAB** where we were introduced to the core values and goals of the IT department.
 - In the hardware lab, our professors elaborated on the vision and mission of the IT department. The vision is particularly inspiring: to train students from villages and transform them into professionals. This commitment to empowering rural students underscores the department’s dedication to inclusive education and social upliftment.
 - The mission emphasized preparing us to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving tech industry through a comprehensive curriculum and hands-on experiences.
 - After the enlightening session in the hardware lab, we had the opportunity to visit various other labs within the IT department. Each lab offered a glimpse into different facets of IT, from software development to network systems, and more. These visits were incredibly informative, allowing us to see the practical applications of our coursework and the resources available to us.

We learned various strategies and techniques to enhance our problem-solving skills and adaptability. The discussion provided valuable insights on how to think on our feet and make effective decisions in dynamic situations.

## **DAY 6**

- On  our Sixth Day First Lecture was of **UHV**.
- In *UHV* we learnt that
   1. Human Being is coexistence of **SELF** and **BODY**
   2. The need of the Self is *Happiness* (e.g. feeling of respect leading to happiness) while the need of the  Body is *Physical facility* (e.g. food).
   3. The Self has the activity of desire, thought and expectation which are continuous. On the other hand, any activity of the Body, like eating, walking, etc. is temporary in time.
   4. The response of the Body is based on recognizing and fulfilling whereas the response of the Self is based on knowing, assuming, recognizing and fulfilling
   5. The Self as the Consciousness Entity, the Body as the Material Entity
   6. The needs of the Self and the Body are of two different types, so they have to be fulfilled separately. Agross misunderstanding is to assume the two to be the same, and this leads to the feeling of deprivation and exploitation.
   7.  The activities of desire, thought and expectation are together called imagination. Imagination is continuously going on in the Self. The sources of imagination can be sensation, pre-conditioning or natural acceptance. There is harmony in the Self when the imagination is in line with one’s natural acceptance. Harmony in the Self is in continuity when all the activities of the Self are awakened.
   8.  When the Self has a feeling of self-regulation (the responsibility for nurturing, protection and right utilisation of the Body), and it is able to fulfil this responsibility, the Body is in harmony (good health). This feeling of self-regulation is instrumental in identifying the need for physical facility and ensuring prosperity.
    
- In Our Second Lecture  our **SENIORS** gave us brief Information about **CANVA** . We also made our First **TEMPLATE** using canva
- Later in the day, we attended a meeting of CodeGNE. This session was focused on the theme of improvisation. We learned various strategies and techniques to enhance our problem-solving skills and adaptability. The discussion provided valuable insights on how to think on our feet and make effective decisions in dynamic situations.
