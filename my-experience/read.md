## **DAY 1**
- My first day at **GNDEC** started with all the  students assembling  in the **COLLEGE GURUDWARA SAHIB**  for kirtan and ardas 
- After that all students assembled in auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, **Harpreet Mam**. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the **GNDEC** family.

Our **Principal Sir** then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: **“Seize the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”**

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: **“Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn.”**

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again.
