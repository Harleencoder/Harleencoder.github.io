 - In the hardware lab, our professors elaborated on the vision and mission of the IT department. The vision is particularly inspiring: to train students from villages and transform them into professionals. This commitment to empowering rural students underscores the department’s dedication to inclusive education and social upliftment.
 - The mission emphasized preparing us to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving tech industry through a comprehensive curriculum and hands-on experiences.

Each lab offered a glimpse into different facets of IT, from software development to network systems, and more.

## **DAY 6**

- On  our Sixth Day **First Lecture** was of **UHV**.
- In *UHV* we learnt that
   1. Human Being is coexistence of **SELF** and **BODY**
   2. The need of the Self is *Happiness* (e.g. feeling of respect leading to happiness) while the need of the  Body is *Physical facility* (e.g. food).
   3. The Self has the activity of desire, thought and expectation which are continuous. On the other hand, any activity of the Body, like eating, walking, etc. is temporary in time.
   4. The response of the Body is based on recognizing and fulfilling whereas the response of the Self is based on knowing, assuming, recognizing and fulfilling
   5. The Self as the Consciousness Entity, the Body as the Material Entity
   6. The needs of the Self and the Body are of two different types, so they have to be fulfilled separately. Agross misunderstanding is to assume the two to be the same, and this leads to the feeling of deprivation and exploitation.
   7.  The activities of desire, thought and expectation are together called imagination. Imagination is continuously going on in the Self. The sources of imagination can be sensation, pre-conditioning or natural acceptance. There is harmony in the Self when the imagination is in line with one’s natural acceptance. Harmony in the Self is in continuity when all the activities of the Self are awakened.
   8.  When the Self has a feeling of self-regulation (the responsibility for nurturing, protection and right utilisation of the Body), and it is able to fulfil this responsibility, the Body is in harmony (good health). This feeling of self-regulation is instrumental in identifying the need for physical facility and ensuring prosperity.
    
- In Our **Second Lecture**  our **SENIORS** gave us brief Information about **CANVA** . We also made our First **TEMPLATE** using canva
- Later in the day, we attended a meeting of **CodeGNE**. This session was focused on the theme of improvisation. We learned various strategies and techniques to enhance our problem-solving skills and adaptability. The discussion provided valuable insights on how to think on our feet and make effective decisions in dynamic situations.

 <h1>Workshop 3: A Deep Dive into Pandoc</h1>
  - On Day 8 of my college journey, we embarked on a mission to demystify Pandoc, a versatile document conversion tool, through our third workshop. Our team leader assigned tasks to team members and all performed their tasks very well.

## The Technical Hurdles
Our first challenge hit us as soon as we tried to set up. We realized we didn’t have the necessary converters for screen sharing, which put a wrench in our plans. To make matters worse, the WiFi connection decided to be uncooperative. Despite these setbacks, we managed to push through and start the workshop, determined to make it a success.

## The Presentation
- Karmandeep Kaur took the stage first, providing an engaging introduction to Pandoc. She laid a solid foundation, explaining what Pandoc is and its importance in converting documents from one format to another.
- Following Karmandeep, Sharandeep Kaur walked the audience through the installation process. She ensured that everyone understood how to set up Pandoc on their own systems, making it accessible for everyone to follow along.
- Next, I  with the assistance of Kamaljeet kaur , demonstrated the basic conversion of a markdown file to HTML and DOCX.
- Akshay then explained the difference between files processed with and without the standalone function. His detailed explanation highlighted the nuances and options available in Pandoc, providing deeper insights into its capabilities.
- Finally our  leader, explained the process of making an ebook using Pandoc. His  hands-on demonstration made the process look straightforward and easy to replicate, boosting the audience’s confidence.

## Audience Engagement
One of the most rewarding aspects of the workshop was the audience. They were incredibly attentive and stayed with us until the very end. Many of them participated in hands-on activities, which was encouraging to see. They were keen to learn, asking questions and clearing their doubts, which made the session interactive and lively.

## Reflection
Looking back, despite the initial technical challenges, the workshop was a success. The teamwork and resilience displayed by everyone were commendable. Each member of the team played a crucial role, and the audience’s engagement made all the efforts worthwhile.

As a leader, this experience taught me the importance of adaptability and teamwork. It reinforced the value of preparation and the ability to think on one’s feet. Most importantly, it was a reminder that with determination and collaboration, we can overcome any obstacle.

I’m grateful for the opportunity to lead such a dedicated team and to share knowledge with an enthusiastic audience. This workshop was not just about Pandoc; it was about learning, growing, and moving forward together.
